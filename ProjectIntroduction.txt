Project Introduction

the goal of this project is to create an all-in-one education workspace where you can plan out your schedules, take notes, make to-do lists,
list achievements, and more quality of life features to help you with your studies. although this is aimed for students,
even people with jobs will be able to use this.

Project Functions

this project aims to be an all-in-one workspace for students, but since this is just at startup, it will at first have these following features:
- to-do lists
- planner
- calendar
- note-taking

but as time goes on, we plan to incorporate these features:
- pomodoro study timer
- class/course section
- instructor lists
- simple calculator
and many more!
